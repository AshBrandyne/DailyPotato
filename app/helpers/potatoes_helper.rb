module PotatoesHelper

  

# Rails “helpers” are very specifically view helpers. 
#They’re automatically included in views, but not in controllers or models. 
#That’s on purpose.

#Code in the application helper is included in all the views in your application. 
#Code in other helpers is included in the corresponding view. 
#If you find yourself writing big loops, method calls or 
#other logic in the view but it’s clearly display logic, move it into a method 
#in the helper.
